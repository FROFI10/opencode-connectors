# opencode-connectors

A collection of connectors (tools / plugins) for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and other AI agents that speak the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

> **Status:** scaffold + two connectors (`github`, `browser`). Use `connectors/_template` as a starting point when you add a new one.

## Available connectors

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`github`](connectors/github/) | Manage GitHub on your behalf: create/delete repos, commit files, manage branches, open and merge PRs, work with issues. |
| [`browser`](connectors/browser/) | Drive a real Chromium browser (Playwright + stealth-plugin). Navigate, click, type, screenshot, extract data, persistent login state. |

## What is a connector?

A connector is a bridge between an AI agent (like OpenCode) and an external service (GitHub, Telegram, Slack, your own API, a database, etc.).

It does three things:

1. **Authenticates** with the external service (API key, OAuth, token).
2. **Exposes actions** to the agent as named *tools* with typed inputs and outputs (e.g. `send_email`, `list_repos`, `create_issue`).
3. **Executes** those actions on behalf of the user when the agent calls them.

Most modern agents speak MCP, so a connector here is implemented as a small MCP server. The same connector can then be plugged into OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue, or anything else that supports MCP.

```

Each connector lives in its own folder under `connectors/` and is an independent npm package, managed as a workspace.

## Quick start — add a new connector

```bash
# 1. Copy the template
cp -r connectors/_template connectors/my-service

# 2. Edit name in connectors/my-service/package.json
# 3. Implement your tools in connectors/my-service/src/index.ts
# 4. Install deps & build
npm install
npm run build --workspace=connectors/my-service
```

See [`docs/how-to-add-a-connector.md`](docs/how-to-add-a-connector.md) for details.

## Using a connector with OpenCode

The repo ships with an [`opencode.json`](opencode.json) that already wires up the `github` connector. To add another connector, append it under `mcp`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "my-service": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node", "./connectors/my-service/dist/index.js"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

OpenCode spawns the connector as a subprocess and auto-discovers its tools.

## Quick start

The repo ships with `opencode.json` configured to use the `github` connector with an **encrypted GitHub token**. The token is decrypted at runtime using a master passphrase you provide via `OPENCODE_PASSPHRASE` — the passphrase never lives in the repo.

The fastest way to get going on Windows:

```powershell
./setup.ps1
```

That installs deps, builds, prompts for the master passphrase, and (optionally) saves it to your PowerShell profile.

Or do it manually:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
export OPENCODE_PASSPHRASE="your-master-passphrase"   # or $env:OPENCODE_PASSPHRASE in PowerShell
# Then launch OpenCode in this folder.
```

See [`connectors/github/README.md`](connectors/github/README.md) for token-management details.
